Doctor Appointment Booking System – Project Output Explanation

Welcome to the Doctor Appointment Booking System. This web application streamlines healthcare access for patients, doctors, and administrators.

1. User Authentication and Dashboard

Users can register and log in securely.
Once logged in, patients see a dashboard showing their upcoming appointments, appointment history, and notifications if they have an appointment today.
Admins and doctors have their own dashboards for managing users, doctors, and appointments.
2. Doctor Search and Booking

Patients can browse a list of doctors, filter by specialization, and view detailed doctor profiles.
Each profile displays the doctor’s experience, consultation fee, ratings, and available timings.
To book an appointment, patients select a doctor, choose a date and time, and provide a reason for the visit.
The system prevents double-booking and ensures only valid time slots can be selected.
3. Appointment Management

Patients can view, reschedule, or cancel their appointments.
Doctors can see their daily schedule and manage their availability.
After visiting the doctor, patients can leave reviews, but only if they have completed an appointment.
4. Notification System

A notification bell icon at the top right alerts users if they have an appointment today.
Clicking the bell shows a message about the appointment.
5. Medical Chatbot

The integrated AI-powered medical chatbot assists users with health questions, doctor information, and appointment guidance.
Users can interact by typing or using voice input.
The chatbot provides general health advice, explains how to book appointments, and answers questions about symptoms or doctors.
It also summarizes the user’s mentioned symptoms and conditions for context.
6. Lung and Pneumonia AI Prediction

The system includes a CT Scan Prediction feature.
Users can upload their chest CT scan image.
The AI model analyzes the image and predicts whether there are signs of pneumonia or lung disease.
Results are displayed instantly, helping users understand their risk, but always with a disclaimer that this is not a substitute for professional diagnosis.
7. Security and Admin Features

All sensitive data is protected.
Admins can manage users, doctors, and appointments from a dedicated dashboard.
Conclusion This project makes healthcare more accessible and efficient by combining appointment management, AI-powered health assistance, and secure user experiences—all in one platform.

You can adjust the script to match your exact UI and features.
